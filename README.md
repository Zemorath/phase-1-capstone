## Introduction

Having worked at a bookstore, one of the things I hear a lot is how difficult it is to find a good app or program to keep track of books you have read, are reading, or will read.
Most of the ones available today require you to pay a small fee to add an amount of books past a set limit. My idea with this was to create an open source program to help you keep
track of them without making you pay. 

## Features

* Add your favorite cover!
* Currently able to use either book title or ISBN
* Add any number of books
* Choose which edition to add

## Roadmap

* Add a flip feature so each card default shows just the cover and hovering over flips it to show book information
* Format information on card better
* Refine and remove duplicate search results
* Add drag and drop to reorder books
* Add sorting capabilities
* Add web page display to look like a bookshelf
