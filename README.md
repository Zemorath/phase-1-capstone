## Introduction

Having worked at a bookstore, one of the things I hear a lot is how difficult it is to find a good app or program to keep track of books you have read, are reading, or will read.
Most of the ones available today require you to pay a small fee to add an amount of books past a set limit. My idea with this was to create an open source program to help you keep
track of them without making you pay.
